###########reading the correct shape containing the polygons we need##################
gr <- readShapeSpatial("C:/shapefiles greece/GRC_adm2.shp")

####look at the data inside the shape file####
head(gr@data)  ##we need the NAME_2 variable for plotting later


######example to see how it looks like in a map############
greece <-c(geom_polygon(aes(long,lat,group=group), size = 0.1, colour= "#090D2A",
                        fill="#090D2A", alpha=0.4, data=gr))

ggplot() + greece


###########small change in the shape file, changing the NAME_2 of two observations so as not to have a conflict with our data later#############
